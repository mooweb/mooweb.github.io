      <div class="tab-pane fade" id="nav-breakdown" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-breakdown">
        <p>During this project, selected student groups will work together with assigned mentor(s). Project submissions should focus on using technology to solve an existing community issue and students should work on a project that is small enough in scope to develop a working prototype by the end of the camp. Project ideas must be researched prior to submitting an application to ensure the challenge/issue exists and similar solutions are not in place to address it. If similar solutions are in place, your team's project idea must include an innovative approach to tackle the issue.
